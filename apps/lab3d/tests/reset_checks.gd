## Headless checks of "처음으로" (Phase 1 Task 4g bug fix, 2026-10-23 user report: 처음으로 did
## not bring the bodies back; "누르자마자 처음 상태로"), run by run_tests.gd. Through the real input path: a screen
## touch on the action button (InputEventScreenTouch pushed into the viewport, not the signal), and
## with frames that have no fixed step (physics ticks lowered to 20 /s while it is checked, as on a
## device): the first action of each of the 11 experiments, then 처음으로 at several moments (the
## bread cat winding up, just after a release, in flight, landed / rolling, with the sidebar open, with
## the box held by a press). From the press frame on, for the next frames: every rigid body at its start
## pose, every ArtJuice mesh at rest (no grow-in), the camera at the view the screen opened with, the
## panel values, graph and status as at the start, the bread cat holding the ball. The engine bug this
## guards (a pose set from input reverted by the next step's state report) is in BodyResync.
## The same guard for the other changes from input (PR #16 review): 공 놓기 pressed again after the
## ball landed (the ball and its shadow at the launch point during the wind-up, the release from
## there), and the landed ball picked up and put down on the launch line, or picked up, dragged and
## put back (a cancelled touch).
