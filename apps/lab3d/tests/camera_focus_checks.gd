## Headless checks of the close-up (CameraRig.focus; apps/lab3d/README.md, close-up), run by
## run_tests.gd. A character that acts is framed closer for a moment, then the view eases back to the
## whole lab; it is the camera only.
## 1. state machine (the rig alone): a close-up keeps the mode and the user's view (get_state), eases
##    in, ends now or after a delay and eases back to exactly the user's view; a two-finger gesture
##    ends it, a mode change or set_state (처음으로) drops it at once (snap), only the front view
##    takes one, focus_enabled false takes none.
## 2. throw (projectile screen): no close-up (2026-10-28 user): the camera does not move from
##    "공 놓기" to the landing, the ball leaves the paw inside the view, the formula path on screen.
## 3. push (friction screen): no close-up (2026-10-28 user): pressing and holding the box keeps the
##    view while the push grows, and from the step the box slides the camera transform does not
##    change while the box is held (the red handle went on 2026-10-28; before, picking it up framed
##    the cat, box and handle closer).
