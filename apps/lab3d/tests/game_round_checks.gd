## Plan G4 — the projectile's mission round, start to end on one screen: the stamp strip, Dugi asking
## the prediction in his dialogue box with two picture buttons, three slingshot throws in a row (no
## 처음으로 between them: the next press is the next shot), the reason told once after the first
## throw (later explanations are the lab's observe text again), the stamps filling, the done text and
## the puppy's celebration on the last one only. A reopened finished place keeps its stamps, asks
## nothing and never celebrates again. A landing whose engine report comes after the status flip
## still earns its stamp. The physics is read only (mission_checks: the same flight with or without
## the round).
