## The night map (2026-10-28 user-approved "explore the night map in a fixed order"): the fixed order
## and the next spot, only the next and the found spots open (a locked tap opens nothing, Puppy says
## his line and the landmark shakes), the names hidden until found, Puppy's riddle when the map opens
## (after a flag raise and a flight too) and again on a tap on him or 단서, the hint's glint after the
## delay, the night lifting with the pieces (day after the finale), the found spots lit, old saves,
## a direct --experiment launch never blocked and the measured map (bench) unchanged: day, every name,
## every spot open. Story.enabled is on only inside these checks (and restored).
