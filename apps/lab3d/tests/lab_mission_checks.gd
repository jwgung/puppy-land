## Plan G2 — the missions of the other 10 labs on their real screens. Per lab a scripted round
## through the screen's own paths (conditions with _set_control, buttons with experiment_action, a
## ball let go where a finger would put it, and the labs' existing test hooks for the hand on a
## press: the push force, the lever's held force, the pulley's stroke): an attempt that misses
## its stage (short, or made under other conditions) earns nothing; each stage is reachable inside
## the lab's control ranges and earns exactly one stamp; the setup that cleared a stage, tried again
## unchanged, never earns the next one (each stage asks for a changed condition: check_conditions
## for every lab). The hidden answers read "?" and the hidden graph lines are not drawn until the
## run has its result; the orbit draws no predicted path before its launch.
## Physics invariance: the same script on a screen without the missions / predict blocks gives the
## same formula values, statuses and engine bodies at every physics step. The prediction pictures
## of every kind draw.
