## Headless checks of the bread cat (Phase 1 Task 4g: CatActor wearing BreadCat; art-direction.md section 11), run by
## run_tests.gd. "물리는 모델, 고양이는 연기": the cat acts in step with the formula model and never
## changes it.
## 1. throw (projectile, through the "공 놓기" action): before the release the ball's mesh is in the
##    paw (the carried centre = the paw's held point, CARRY_TOL) while the ball body waits at the
##    launch point; on the release frame the held point = the ball body = the launch point
##    (RELEASE_TOL) before any physics step; the run from the release on (engine positions every
##    step, panel values) is the same as a direct release() and the throw takes THROW_FRAMES frames.
## 2. push (friction): both paws on the box mesh's -x face (CONTACT_TOL) and inside the face, on a
##    push, a pull, while sliding and after a stop; with the box reactions off the face is the body's;
##    the cat leans into a push and back on a pull; the box motion and panel are the same without
##    the cat (every step).
## 3. no physics: the cat has no collision object, shape or area (no layer at all), the labs' bodies
##    are the ones they had; mesh budget.
## 4. layout: in the front camera (phone, tablet, tablet with the sidebar open) the cat is in the
##    view, clear of the title, key cards, buttons and actions, and in front of nothing it should not
##    hide (the line of sight to the ball, its formula path and the box misses the cat).
## 5. storybook look (Task 4g2): every cat mesh draws the toon (cel) shader with the brown outline
##    pass (art_outline.gdshader: front faces culled, grown along NORMAL, at least the reference's
##    0.010 m), and the meshes keep the outline's contract (vertices at one position share one normal,
##    so the grown hull does not tear at seams); no other mesh of the lab (ball, box, island) has it.
## 6. every other lab (2026-10-27): a scripted run of each of the 9 labs (and 12 other conditions,
##    ROLE_RUNS) gives the same bodies (every step), panel and graph with and without the cat; in the
##    screen (phone, tablet, tablet with the sidebar) every frame the paws are on what the cat holds
##    (2e-3 m), its arms stretch at most STRETCH_MAX, its bag, head and tail are in no body (all of it
##    once it let go and settled: no moving body passes through it) and clear of the apparatus; on
##    the view it is inside, clear of the overlays, Dugi and Puppy and hides no body position or key
##    apparatus point; it cheers at the result; the orbit's cat stays under the orbit plane; one cat
##    per lab with no physics (nor its stand), 7 drawn nodes and the vertex budget.
