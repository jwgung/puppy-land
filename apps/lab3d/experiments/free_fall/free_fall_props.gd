## Grass island props of the free-fall lab (apps/lab3d/docs/art-direction.md, section 9). Meshes and
## reactions only: the floor and ball bodies are built by free_fall.gd and are not changed here.
## - a blue height ruler (pole + white ticks every 0.5 m, longer every metre) behind the balls,
## - a yellow drop pad under each waiting ball that flips down and hides on release (the "놓기"
##   reaction) and comes back with a pop when the balls are put back,
## - the island, the ruler's blob shadow and each ball's ArtJuice (squash, dust, shadow; dust kept
##   to 10 grains per ball so three landings at once stay under the 32-grain budget),
## - each ball looks as heavy as it is (set_look, 2026-10-28): one stuff, its radius the cube root
##   of its mass against the 1 kg violet ball's 0.25 m, grown from the body's bottom (ArtJuice.look_scale),
## - the bread cat (CatActor wearing the BreadCat look, 2026-10-27) behind the leftmost ball on its
##   right, between the pink and the red ball (2026-11-02 user; it stood left of the pink one), holding
##   it on its pad with its right paw, on a stack of bread crates as tall as the ball is
##   high (CatCrates); "공 놓기" lets go (the arm follows down), it cheers when all balls landed. A
##   finger holding that ball: the cat only stands by. Only meshes: the balls wait and fall as the
##   formula says.
