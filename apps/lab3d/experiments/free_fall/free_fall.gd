## Guided free-fall lab (Phase 1 Task 4a; web preset "free-fall"): balls of different mass dropped
## in the chosen field land at the same time. Since 2026-10-29 (user: "2개만 놓고 하자") two balls:
## the light yellow one (0.5 kg) and the heavy red one (the "mass" control, 3 kg by default); the web's
## third, violet reference ball is not in the 3D lab (the web keeps its three; the law is the same).
## Conditions: gravity (the web's buttons), the drop height of both (slider) and the red ball's
## mass. A finger drags either ball up or down (2026-10-27, one drag per lab: "drop_<ball>" objects on
## a vertical line through the ball). Since 2026-10-29 (the piece game "두 공을 같이 떨어뜨려 버튼
## 누르기", FreeFallGame) letting go sets that ball's own drop height (the other stays), so the child
## starts the two balls level or not; the "height" control (the "자세히" slider) still sets both.
## Heights are whole metres (1–8 m, the slider's and the drags' 1 m step: user "스텝을 크게 해서 쉽게").
## A finger does not move a ball sideways (definition: "drag": false).
## Motion: Jolt + UniformFieldCorrector (uniform_field_lab.gd). Displayed numbers: PhysicsLaws at the formula time (the landing at landing_time(0, -g, h0)); the engine is
## only the graph's "시뮬레이션" points and the measured landing times.
## Each ball looks as heavy as it is (2026-10-28, look_radius): the red ball grows and shrinks with
## its mass from its body's bottom; the bodies (BALL_RADIUS spheres), their fall and the landings stay.
