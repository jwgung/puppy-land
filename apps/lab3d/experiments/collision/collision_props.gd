## Grass island props of the collision lab (apps/lab3d/docs/art-direction.md, section 9). Meshes and
## reactions only: the floor and ball bodies are built and moved by collision.gd; nothing here
## touches a body (the balls' rolling turns a child mesh, the squash is ArtJuice's mesh transform).
## - the rail: a yellow lane (14 x 1.4 m) between two white guide rails, white metre ticks, a white
##   middle mark between the two start halves and blue bumpers at both walls (visual: the walls are
##   the formula's; each bumper's face is where its ball's look meets it, set_sizes),
## - ball A blue, ball B orange (the web's object colours, from the palette), yarn balls (Task 4g;
##   until then each with a white band)
##   that shows it rolling, its ArtJuice (shadow, dust, squash),
## - the balls' look follows their masses (set_sizes, 2026-10-28 user request: two 1 kg balls looked
##   different): one stuff, each radius from its own mass only, LOOK_1KG (m / 1 kg)^(1/3)
##   (MassLook.radius; 2026-11-03 playtest "주황 공을 키우면 파랑 공이 줄어드는지": until then both radii
##   came from the mass ratio with a fixed sum, so a heavier orange ball made the blue one smaller).
##   Each grows from its body's bottom (ArtJuice.look_scale). So that the two looks resting on the
##   floor still touch exactly at the model's contact (centres radius_a + radius_b apart along the
##   rail), each look is moved `shift` along the rail away from the other (ArtJuice.set_carry; it
##   touches at 2 sqrt(a b) apart, MassLook.touching_shift). The model, its radii and the bodies stay
##   as they are. Ball A only ever meets the left bumper and B the right one (A starts left of B and
##   the model never lets them pass), so each bumper's face is put where its ball's look reaches at
##   the model's wall bounce.
## - one arrow per ball above it: the purple velocity arrow while waiting (the web's purple arrow;
##   while ball A is pulled, the pull's velocity), the momentum arrow p = mv in the ball's colour
##   while it moves (the web's momentum arrows; length 0.25 m per kg m/s),
## - the slingshot's pull line (PullDots, 2026-10-28): white dots from ball A back to where the
##   finger pulls it, only while a pull is held,
## - the force pair at the contact for 0.5 s after a hit: two equal arrows pointing apart (red on A,
##   green on B; the web's "충돌 순간의 힘" overlay),
## - reactions: a hit = both balls squash along the rail (ArtJuice.bump) with dust; release = stretch;
##   reset = pop.
## - the bread cat (CatActor wearing the BreadCat look, 2026-10-27) on the lane behind the blue ball A
##   (on the side A will go away from), both paws on the ball; "출발" pushes (the arms follow through
##   along the start velocity) and it hops off the lane to behind the rail (a ball may come back);
##   next to a bumper it stands behind the rail and reaches over it. It cheers after the first
##   collision. Only meshes: the balls move as the formula model says from the release on.
