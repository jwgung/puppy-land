## Grass island props of the push friction lab (apps/lab3d/docs/art-direction.md, section 9). Meshes
## and reactions only: the floor and box bodies are built by friction.gd and are not changed here.
## - a yellow floor track (the web's "마찰이 있는 바닥" strip) with white metre ticks, a white start
##   line and blue bumpers beyond both ends; inside its yellow rim the track shows the chosen
##   material (SurfaceSkin, set_surface: 2026-10-28, rubber / wood / steel / clay),
## - an orange box (the web's box colour) with its ArtJuice (shadow, dust, squash); it looks as heavy
##   as it is (set_look, 2026-10-28): one stuff, its side the cube root of its mass against the 8 kg
##   start box's 0.7 m, grown from the body's bottom (ArtJuice.look_scale). The body (a 0.7 m cube),
##   its friction and the formula's track-end stops stay; the bumpers move to where the look stops,
##   and the cat's paws go to the look's height,
## - the push gauge (ForceGauge, 2026-10-28: the red handle and its rod went, the child presses and
##   holds the box itself) beside the box's +x face while the box is held: the push's share of
##   the most a hold gives (no numbers),
## - reactions: the box starts to move = dust puff + small stretch; it stops = settle; a track end =
##   wobble.
## - the bread cat (CatActor wearing the BreadCat look, Task 4g) behind the box (-x): both paws on
##   the box's left face (where the box mesh is, squash included), leaning into the push with the
##   force's share of the maximum static friction (the held push grows until the box starts, then stays; so does the lean), shuffling
##   along while the box moves; a small hop when the box comes to rest. Only meshes: the force, the
##   box and the panel are the lab's.
