## Grass island props of the projectile lab (apps/lab3d/docs/art-direction.md, section 9). Meshes and
## reactions only: the floor, ball and arrow-knob bodies are built by projectile.gd.
## - the purple velocity arrow (the web's purple arrow, VelocityArrow) from the ball to its tip
##   (no yellow knob box at its end since 2026-11-03), rebuilt only when its length changes (about 60 vertices),
## - the formula path: PATH_DOTS white dots on x(t), y(t) from the launch to the landing (one
##   MultiMesh, updated only when a condition or the start changes) and a white ring where the
##   formula lands,
## - white distance ticks on the floor every metre (every 5 m longer), the island and the ball's
##   ArtJuice,
## - the fences at both ends of the throw line (Task 4f): white board walls between blue posts, one
##   mesh; a landed ball bounces back from their faces (RollingContact; the engine has no fence body).
## - the bread cat (CatActor wearing the BreadCat look, Task 4g) behind the launch point, holding
##   the waiting ball in its left paw: its paw is the launch point (2026-10-23 user decision: no
##   launch post or pad). When the launch point is higher than its paw reaches from the floor, it
##   stands on a stack of wooden bread crates as tall as needed (CatCrates). "공 놓기" makes it
##   wind up and swing, and the ball leaves its paw at the launch point on the frame the lab
##   releases it (throw()); it cheers when the ball lands. Only meshes: the ball body waits at the launch point the whole time (the paw
##   carries the ball's mesh, ArtJuice.set_carry), and the formula clock starts at the release.
