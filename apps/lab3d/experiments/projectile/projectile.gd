## Guided projectile lab (Phase 1 Task 4a; web preset "projectile"): one ball is thrown from a
## launch stand with the speed and direction of the purple velocity arrow, in the chosen field.
## Conditions: gravity (the web's buttons), launch angle (0..90 deg, 15 deg steps like the web
## arrow's snap) and speed (1..9 m/s; the web arrow is capped at 9.09 m/s). The arrow's yellow knob
## can be dragged in the vertical plane of the throw (web step 1, "보라색 화살표를 끌어 방향을
## 정해요"; ArrowSurface), and the ball moved along the launch line and raised with its height
## handle (launch height 0..3 m; the web launches from 0.42 m, the default here is 0.5 m). In the
## game (2026-10-27, one drag per lab) the finger only pulls the slingshot: the launch height is the
## "launch_height" control in "자세히" (the same start as the height handle made), the arrow knob
## and the handle are not picked up (definition: "drag": false, "height": false).
## Motion: Jolt + UniformFieldCorrector. Displayed numbers: PhysicsLaws (flight time, range and apex
## to the floor level from landing_time / apex_rise; position and velocity at the formula time).
## The engine gives only the graph's "시뮬레이션" points and the measured landing distance.
