## The slide's piece game (2026-10-29 "조각 꺼내기"): three rows of dominoes, small, bigger and the big
## pillar with the star piece on top. A stage asks for the box to get to its row past the slide's end
## (reach_n below): the faster it leaves the end (v = √(2 a d), a = g (sin θ − μk cos θ), d the run
## from the start to the end), the farther it goes, on steel → steeper wood → steepest rubber.
##
## Where the box arrives (2026-10-29 user, twice: "미끄럼틀은 여전히 착지 지점과 도미노의 위치가
## 안맞다"): past the slide's end the box drops on g from the end (fixed 0.3 m over the ground at
## every slope, 2026-10-29), lands on the floor and the floor's friction stops it
## (InclineFriction.arrival(): the formula's projectile and v²/(2μg) on the floor, which the engine
## box follows within 1 cm).
##
## One fixed row per stage (2026-10-29 user: the row that moved to where the box would stop gave the
## answer away before the release): the stage's row stands in the box's lane (z 0) at LANE_FACE (its
## first domino's near face), whatever the material, slope or start. The stage is judged by whether
## the formula's way meets the row (the lab's contact_step() and reach_1–3): the box's square on its
## flight and floor run against the standing dominoes' boxes. So a box can fall short. Where it meets
## the row:
## - the moment the engine box's square reaches a standing domino (touched()) the row's chain starts
##   (each domino NEXT_S after the one before), stamped or not (a setting the stage does not want
##   knocks it over too: it stands again at the next attempt), and the box shoves each domino it
##   reaches so it never sits inside one (push());
## - a box that stops short within NEAR_MISS of the row makes it wobble.
## The other rows wait beside the lane (ROW_Z, past the slide's end, as before), standing or fallen.
## The pillar's fall throws the piece down on uniform gravity (LabGame.launch_piece) on the last
## stamp; knocked over without it, the piece rides on its top. Visual only: the dominoes are pictures
## on the floor (no body), the box and the numbers are the lab's.
