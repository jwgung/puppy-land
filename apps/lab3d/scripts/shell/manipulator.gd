## Shell object manipulation (Phase 1 Task 2b): one finger (or the left mouse button) picks up an
## object, drags it on its surface, and puts it down on the surface's grid. Fed by
## View3D.single_pointer; the experiment says which objects can be picked and on which surface
## (definition.manipulation + Experiment.manipulation_*), see apps/lab3d/README.md "조작".
##
## - Pick: one ray from the finger (only manipulable bodies count); when it misses, the object whose
##   centre is within pick_radius() UI units on screen (a 0.4 m box is ~36 units wide at the default
##   distance, smaller than a child's fingertip; the labs ask for a child's finger, manipulation.grab_radius,
##   and never less than FINGER_MM on the glass). An object whose rule says `"drag": false` stays an
##   object of the lab (its grid, a restored placement) but a finger never picks it up (2026-10-27: one
##   drag per lab, the other handles moved to the picture buttons or "자세히").
## - Drag: the finger ray is projected on the surface (ManipSurface.project_ray) at the object's
##   centre height, keeping the offset between finger and object from the pick-up (an offset on
##   the surface, so a turning camera does not change it; the object follows the finger on screen
##   while the assist turns the view, see _follow_camera). A grazing ray
##   leaves the object where it is; a finger past the region holds the object at its edge, and past
##   a lab's limit inside it the marker and the landing place stay at that limit (2026-10-31: the
##   limit is the most, not a refusal; the object lands there on release). The object is frozen while
##   held and follows the finger unsnapped; the footprint marker shows the grid point it will land
##   on (white), the nearest one the lab allows (Experiment.nearest_placement).
## - Height: an object whose rule allows it shows a vertical handle beside it when selected; the
##   knob drags the height along the surface normal only (snapped to its step).
## - Put down: a valid target places the object there (Experiment.manipulation_placed); an invalid
##   one, a second finger, or a system cancel puts it back where it was picked up.
## - Slingshot (Plan G3, set_slingshot): the launch object is not dragged; a press on it (or, after a
##   run, near its launch point: the run is reset first) pulls it back, Angry Birds style. The launch
##   is the reversed pull, snapped to the surface's angle / speed grids and clamped to its ranges
##   (or the lab's own pull -> value, set_slingshot `value`: the collision lab's rail, the orbit's
##   plane); only a release after the finger left PULL_DEAD_ZONE throws. A tap selects it (its
##   height handle); a cancel throws nothing.
## - Hold (2026-10-28, rule `"hold": true`): a press on the object (within pick_radius() of its pick
##   point, Experiment.manipulation_pick_point) holds it: nothing moves under the finger, the lab
##   ramps its applied force while held (Experiment.hold_started / hold_ended, HoldRamp). Lifting
##   the finger, a second finger, a system cancel or a control change ends the hold (force 0).
## - The camera turns to show the surface while dragging if the view is too flat (CameraRig.begin_assist).
##   A close-up's camera move (CameraRig.is_framing, or its cut) leaves a held object where it is (_keep_held).
## Work per input event: at most one ray (pick) and one shape query (only when the grid target or
## the height changes). A pointer event makes a few small values (the finger ray, one projected
## point); every move of the held body goes through Experiment.change_from_input (BodyResync, one
## scan of the experiment's rigid bodies). _process allocates nothing unless the camera turned under
## a held object (then it moves the body like a pointer event).
