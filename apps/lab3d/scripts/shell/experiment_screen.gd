## back / title / settings / sidebar buttons, the experiment's key observations as small cards
## (the definition's key_observations) and its action buttons. Everything else (question, camera modes,
## conditions, all observations, graph, steps, law, terms) is in the right sidebar, which slides
## in and out. When it is open the 3D view shrinks to the area left of it (nothing in the scene is
