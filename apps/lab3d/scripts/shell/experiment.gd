## Base class for a 3D experiment scene. The shell (experiment_screen.gd) owns the camera, the
## gestures and every 2D panel; an experiment only owns its 3D world and physics and answers the
## questions below. Its content (texts, controls, observations, graph, camera views) is data in
## content/experiments/<id>.json, passed in as `definition` before the node enters the tree.
## How to add an experiment: apps/lab3d/README.md ("실험 추가").

extends Node3D

## Emitted when a value shown in the panels changes outside a control (e.g. the box starts to
## slide). The screen also polls observations() at UI_REFRESH_HZ, so this is only a hint.
signal state_changed
## Something visibly hit the ground (strength 0..1). Visual only: the screen gives the camera a
## small dip (CameraRig.nudge). Experiments emit it from their ArtJuice.landed.
signal impact(strength: float)
## A character acts: the lab asks the shell to frame `spec` closer for a moment (CameraRig.focus:
## "box" = world AABB of what to frame, optional "fill", "anchor"). Visual only.
signal close_up(spec: Dictionary)
## The act is over: the view eases back to the user's `after` seconds from now (CameraRig.end_focus).
signal close_up_ended(after: float)
## Something must be seen from a still camera from now on: a close-up or its return ends on this
## frame (CameraRig.cut_focus; a jump only when it had not ended yet).
signal close_up_cut

## The experiment's definition (ExperimentDefinition: content JSON resolved by ExperimentRegistry).
## Read-only for the experiment.
var definition := ExperimentDefinition.new()
## False in a game round (the definition has missions; the screen sets it before the lab enters
## the tree): the lab draws no answer preview before the run, such as the orbit's predicted path.
## Visual only: no body, formula value or status depends on it.

## The pace a run is shown at (2026-10-29 user: the orbit 2.5x faster): the screen sets the
## definition's `time_scale` before the lab enters the tree. A lab that honours it (the orbit) steps its
## model at the same fixed dt, time_scale steps per frame on average, so every displayed number (time,
## period, speed) stays the model's; only the playback is faster. Tests that drive a lab directly keep 1.

## Runs `change`, a change of this experiment from input, between two fixed steps: an action
## (run_action), a condition (set_control), an object picked up, put down or put back
## (manipulation_started / _placed / _cancelled, with the manipulator's own move of the body). The
## bodies it moved keep their new poses, so the engine's report of the step under way cannot move
## them back (BodyResync). Every such path of the shell (ExperimentScreen, Manipulator) goes through
## here; a lab never calls it for its own changes inside the step.

# --- manipulation (Task 2b) ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# definition.manipulation.objects lists the objects a finger may pick up and the rules (surface id,

# preview, and asks the experiment for the geometry and tells it the outcome. While an object is
