## Shell camera: six modes with smooth transitions, limited orbit, zoom and pan.
## Modes: front (정면), three_quarter (3/4), top (위), side (옆), follow (따라가기, tracks
## follow_source.follow_point()), orbit (제한 회전: wherever the user turned it, within the
## experiment's yaw/pitch limits). Preset views and limits come from the experiment's
## definition.camera; a view may look at its own `target` (default: camera.target), e.g. the
## front view a little higher so the top of the apparatus clears the key cards (Task 2d).
## Gestures change the view directly (no lag); mode switches ease over ~0.4 s. Angles: yaw 0 looks along -z (camera on +z), pitch < 0 is above the target.
## Close-up (focus / end_focus): a lab frames a character that acts (the bread cat throwing or
## pushing; Dugi explaining in Task 4h) closer for a moment, then the view eases back to the one the
## user had. Visual only, see focus().

const FOCUS_MODES := ["front"]

## wherever the child turned it: its flag raise, 2026-10-28).

const FOCUS_ANCHOR := Vector2(0.5, 0.55)    # default place of the subject's centre (view fractions, from the top left)


## Frames `spec.box` (a world AABB: the acting character, and what it acts on) closer, keeping the
## view's yaw and pitch: the distance at which the box's height on screen is `spec.fill` (share of
## the view height, FOCUS_FILL) of the view, the look-at point so the box's centre sits at
## `spec.anchor` (fractions of the view from its top left, FOCUS_ANCHOR: e.g. left of the middle
## so a throw to +x has room ahead). Eases in like a mode change (EASE_RATE, ~0.37 s) and stays
## until end_focus(). Visual only: the mode, the view the user had (goal_*, pan, get_state()) and
## nothing of the experiment changes. A two-finger gesture ends it (orbit / zoom / pan_by), a mode
## change or set_state() (처음으로) drops it at once. Returns false (and does nothing) when close-ups
## are off (focus_enabled) or the camera is not in a FOCUS_MODES view.
## Timed (`spec.in_s` given): it eases in over in_s, holds hold_s, eases back over out_s
## (smoothstep blends between the user's view and the close-up) and is exactly the user's view,
## still, after in_s + hold_s + out_s: a lab can have the camera at rest before something it must
## show from a still view (the throw's release, 2026-10-24 user decision).
