## The mission's picture buttons (2026-10-27 user decision "조작이 쉬운게 중요"): which conditions the
## current stage needs, as a few big buttons at the bottom of the lab screen. Before them, every
## stage's condition (the moon, 2 ropes, the small drum, the steel slide) was a chip or a slider
## inside "자세히". A button sets its control through the screen's own condition path (the same
## _set_control as the sidebar's chips and sliders), so the run is the one the sidebar would make.
##
## The definition names the buttons per control in kid.picks:
##   "kid": {"picks": {"gravity": [{"value": "earth", "label": "지구", "picture": "earth"}, ...],
##                     "mass": [{"value": 80.0, "label": "80킬로그램", "picture": "weight", "size": 0.6}, ...]}}
## - `value`: an option id (choice) or a slider value inside its range on its step.
## - `label`: a few words a 7-year-old reads; `picture`: a PickPictures kind (optional `size` 0..1 and
##   `count`, what the drawing shows: a bigger box, 4 ropes).
## A stage shows the controls its `conditions` name, except a control every stage asks the same of
## (the lever's and the pulley's 20 kg load: nothing to choose there). Each shown control has at
## least one button that satisfies the stage and one that does not (the child still chooses);
## with two controls each shows two buttons (the satisfying one and its neighbour), so a row never
## has more than MAX_BUTTONS. No stage conditions (the projectile's throws, a finished round): no row.
## `missions.auto_conditions: true` (2026-10-29, the collision's ball weights): the lab sets the stage's
## conditions itself when a stage becomes current (ExperimentScreen, through its own _set_control), so
## no row is built (groups() is empty) and auto_values() names the values to set.
## Read only: nothing here sets a control or moves a body.
