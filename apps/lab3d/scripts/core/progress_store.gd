## Game progress (Plan G1): the stamps (도장) per island spot. Spots are named by the experiment
## id; each keeps 0..MAX_STAMPS. Stored in user://progress.cfg (ConfigFile, the app's own storage:
## device only, no account). A missing or corrupt file (a broken section, a non-number stamp, a
## value out of range) reads back as no progress at all: the child starts over, nothing else fails.
## This module never touches physics or display: it only counts a stamp when MissionRound hands
## one over (Plan: 판정 값은 공식값, 도장은 진행 저장뿐).

## islands reads as its own and nothing is moved.
