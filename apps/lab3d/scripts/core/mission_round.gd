## The mission round of one lab (apps/lab3d/GLOSSARY.md "미션 라운드"): Puppy's clue, Dugi's prediction
## question, the stages' attempts and stamps, Puppy's result lines, the prediction's reason, the bridge
## to the mission, and the end of the round. One module owns the rules of the definition's `missions`
## and `predict` blocks (validate(), the static queries below) and the round's flow on a screen (the
## instance below). It reads the lab (status(), settled(), observations(), control_value()) and never
## sets a control, runs an action or touches a body, so the engine bodies, the formula values and the
## displayed numbers are the same with or without it (tests/mission_checks.gd, lab_mission_checks.gd).
##
## The flow has no nodes and no clock (tests/mission_round_checks.gd drives it with events only). The
## screen (ExperimentScreen) is its adapter: it tells the round what happened (a touch, an action, a
## condition change, a placed object, a throw, a poll, a picked answer, the clue opened or read) and
## draws what the round says (its signals and queries). The pace of the pictures (the stamp's flight,
## the confetti, the piece, the round-done card) stays the screen's.
##
## The definition's `missions` block (validate()):
##   "missions": { "observe": "range", "compare": "greater",
##                 "judge_on": ["landed"], "reveal_on": ["landed", "out", "fence"],
##                 "hidden_until_end": ["range", ...],
##                 "stages": [ {"threshold": 3.0, "text": "3 m보다 멀리 보내기!"}, ... ] }
## - `judge_on` (default ["landed"]): the lab statuses that are a run's result. A stage is judged only
##   while the status is one of them and the lab is settled (`settled()`: the engine has finished
##   what the status reports, e.g. the projectile's landing, not merely the formula landing within
##   the slack). A lab without a release (the push, the lever, the pulley) names the state that shows
##   the goal ("sliding", "lifted", "held").
## - `observe` (optional): a numeric observation id; the stage's `threshold` must be beaten —
##   `compare` "greater" (default: farther, faster) or "less" (a smaller force) — strictly (exactly
##   at the threshold is not past it). A run with no number there (e.g. "닿지 않아요") is not judged.
##   The number judged is the number shown (2026-10-28): the value rounded as the key card rounds it
##   (shown(): one decimal at most), so a card reading "3.0초" never earns "3초 넘게" and "3.1초" does.
##   Without `observe` a stage is a state goal: reaching a `judge_on` status is the clear.
## - a stage's `conditions` (optional): {control id: option id | number | {"min"?, "max"?}} — the
##   lab's current control values the run must have been made with ("가벼운 상자", "20 kg 짐",
##   "출발 반지름 2 m"). Read through Experiment.control_value; a number matches within 1e-6, a range
##   is inclusive.
## - a stage's `change` (optional): [control id, ...] — the run must differ in at least one of these
##   controls from the run that cleared the stage before ("세기나 각도를 바꿔"): throwing the same
##   throw again never earns the next stamp. The cleared run's control values are kept with the
##   stamps (ProgressStore.cleared); with none kept (a first stage, an older save) any run counts.
## - a stage's `observe`, `compare`, `judge_on` (optional, 2026-10-28): that stage's own rule in
##   place of the block's ("빨리 떨어지게" is "less", "별을 떠나기" is the state "far" with no number:
##   `"observe": ""`). A key the stage leaves out is the block's (MissionRound.rule).
## - a stage's `compare` "near" (2026-10-29, the spring's beat): the shown number is within the
##   stage's `tolerance` (> 0) of its `threshold` ("박자 맞추기": the swing matches the clock's beat).
## - a stage's `also` (optional, 2026-10-29): [{"observe", "compare", "threshold", "tolerance"?}, ...]
##   more numbers the same run must beat, each its own rule on its shown number ("2미터 넘게 당겨
##   박자 맞추기": the pull and the swing). Every one must hold for the stamp.
## - `reveal_on` (default `judge_on`): the statuses where the run has its result: the
##   hidden_until_end values (the formula's answer) read "?" until then, and the prediction's question
##   is over. With `observe`, the result is in once that value is a number too (the pendulum's period
##   after its first full swing).
##
## An attempt (what one stamp at most comes from): the run since the child last acted on the lab —
## an action ("공 놓기", "발사", "처음으로"), a condition change, an object put down or put back (a
## let-go hold, a placed ball), a slingshot throw — or since the lab was back at "ready". The
## screen judges every poll while the status is a judge_on one and keeps judging until the attempt
## earns its stamp (a growing value — orbit laps, a measured period — is judged when it gets there);
## then the attempt is done. A run that falls short changes nothing, and the next attempt is judged
## against the same stage. One attempt clears at most the current stage. The stamps are the child's
## collection — 3 m past, then 5 m past, then 7 m past (stamps: 0..MAX_STAMPS, one per stage).
##
## Stamps live in the progress store (`store`: FileProgress = ProgressStore, user://progress.cfg;
## MemoryProgress in tests), read once at start(); `stamps` is what the round last judged, so a
## judgement reads no file and a stamp is saved once.
