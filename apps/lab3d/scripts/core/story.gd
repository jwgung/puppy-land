## The story "별 조각 찾기" (2026-10-28 user-approved): 과학섬 is one island of the sea country 퍼피랜드.
## Its guiding star (길잡이 별) lights the night sea for the boats; it breaks and 11 pieces fall, one
## at each lab spot. A spot's round completed (all its stamps) is its piece found; the pieces fly to
## the lookout (전망대) on the map and, all 11 there, the star goes back to the sky.
##
## Roles (fixed): 퍼피 the detective finds clues (what, where), 두기두기 the scientist gives the reason
## (why), the bread cat acts and never speaks. The story is pictures and words only: it never sets a
## control, runs an action or reads a body (the labs' physics, missions, controls and numbers are
## the same with or without it).
##
## This is the story's data and saved state: the words (content/story.json, each lab's story.clue),
## the marks in the ProgressStore (prologue / finale played, clue told, piece flown) and whether the
## story runs at all (`enabled`: App turns it on for the child's app, never for a measurement or a
## test that does not ask for it). The map's StoryDirector and the lab screen play it.
