## The story on the island map (the story "별 조각 찾기", 2026-10-28; the words and saved marks: Story).
## It plays three things over the map, each with its own camera moves:
## - the prologue (first launch, or 이야기 다시 보기 in the settings): 8 pages in the dialogue box, the
##   camera gliding from the far sea of 퍼피랜드 to 과학섬, night falling, the guiding star breaking into
##   11 pieces that land at the 11 spots, the dark sea and the lost boats' lanterns, a sweep over the
##   island, then the bread cat on the square as the day comes back. A tap turns the page; 건너뛰기
##   skips it all. Afterwards the map is as it was (no piece on it, the day, the child's camera).
## - a found piece's flight (a round completed in a lab): after the spot's flag rises, a star piece
##   flies from the spot to the lookout (전망대) and the corner emblem (StarEmblem) fills a wedge.
## - the finale (the 11th piece at the lookout, once): the pieces gather into the whole star, Puppy and
##   Dugi speak, the bread cat lifts the star, and the child sends it up like the slingshot in the labs
##   (2026-11-01 user: "여기서 배운 물리 실험을 이용해서 올려보내면 좋겟다"): pull the star down and let
##   go; it flies straight up at the pull's speed under gravity (y = y0 + v t - g t^2 / 2). A weak pull
##   rises and comes back down (Dugi: gravity pulled it back, pull harder); one that reaches the sky
##   (v^2 / 2g past SKY_HIGH) stays there: the sea sparkles, the boats light their lanterns and sail.
##   The star then stays in the map's sky.
##
## The camera: while a prologue or the finale plays the director draws the rig itself (the rig's own
## easing is paused; the child's view, goal_* and pan, is never touched) with eased moves between
## shots, and at the end it eases back to the child's view and hands the rig back exactly there
## (CameraRig.snap). A flight uses the rig's own timed close-up (CameraRig.focus), like the flag raise.
## The night is a global multiplier on the map's shaders (story_tint) and the map's sea colour, put
## back to the day when the map goes away (the labs are always bright).
##
## The night map (2026-10-28 user-approved "explore the night map in a fixed order"): after the
## prologue the map stays night; it lifts a step per piece at the lookout and the finale brings the
## day (Story.night_level; derived from the pieces, nothing new saved). Found spots are lit (map_lit
## lit_mask). Only the next spot (Story.order) and the found ones open; Puppy says the next one's riddle
## in his box at the bottom when the map is free (after a flag raise, a flight, the prologue), again
## on a tap on him or 단서; a tapped locked spot gets "음… 여긴 아닌 것 같아." and a small shake; after
## HINT_DELAY_S without finding it the next spot glints (a small star twinkling, again and again).
##
## Pictures and words only: the director never opens a lab, sets a control or reads a body (the
## finale's launch is its own formula, no physics body). Its 3D
## nodes are outside the map's default view or gone after the story (the map stays clean), apart from
## the sky star after the finale.
