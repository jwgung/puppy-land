## The island home (Plan G2): the 3D island seen from above, with the 5 zones and their 11 spots.
## A tap on a spot (its landmark or its name label) makes the bread cat hop over, then the experiment
## opens; when all its stamps (3) are collected a flag stands there. One finger dragged on the map
## turns it like the 3D labs (two fingers turn and zoom, View3D). The settings button sits on the
## map. The stamps are read once when the map opens (refresh_progress), never per frame.
##
## The home is a Control that owns a View3D (top camera, the map's own island: MapIsland, with
## sea, zone ground, paths and one landmark per spot, MapLandmarks) and the bread cat
## (CatActor) who hops between spots. Spot names are 2D labels projected onto the map
## (the key-card / dialogue pattern: the 3D view under, UI on top). It never touches an
## experiment's physics: the map is its own little world. App.gd builds it the way it built the
## ListScreen (same signals).
