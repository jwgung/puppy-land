## Drag-to-scroll for a ScrollContainer full of buttons, check boxes and sliders (2026-10-29 user
## report "설정 스크롤이 왜 안되는 부분이 많지?").
##
## Why a drag often did not scroll: Godot's ScrollContainer scrolls by a finger only from the events
## that reach its own gui_input (and only on a touchscreen). A press on a Button, CheckBox or Slider
## (mouse_filter STOP, the default) is taken by that control: the touch, its emulated click and the
## whole drag go to it and never reach the scroller. The settings page is mostly such controls (the
## three big quality cards are buttons), so most drags did nothing, and a drag that ended on the
## same button pressed it; a press on a slider even changed its value.
##
## This node (a child of the scroller, Ui.scroller adds it) watches the pointer before the GUI
## (_input). A press inside the scroller (the first finger's touch and its emulated click, or the
## desktop's left button) is held back; then
##   - the finger moves more than SLOP and mostly vertically: the list follows the finger (and keeps
##     a little momentum after the lift); the held press is dropped, so no button, check box or
##     slider under the finger reacts;
##   - it moves more than SLOP sideways: the held events go to the GUI, in order, and the drag goes
##     on as usual (a slider drags);
##   - it lifts within SLOP: a tap. The held press and the release go to the GUI: the control under
##     the finger is pressed as before.
## Held events go on right after the input pass that decided (an event pushed from inside _input
## would end the pass of the one being handled). The scroll bar itself and the wheel are left alone.
