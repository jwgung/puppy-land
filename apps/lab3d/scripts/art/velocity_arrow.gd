## A low-poly arrow prop (grass island style): a 6-sided shaft and a cone head along the node's +x,
## turned about world z by `angle_deg`. Used for the velocity arrows the user drags (projectile,
## collision: the web's purple arrows) and the collision lab's momentum and force arrows. The mesh
## (about 60 vertices) is rebuilt only when the length or the colour changes; turning or moving the
## arrow only sets the node transform. Visual only.
