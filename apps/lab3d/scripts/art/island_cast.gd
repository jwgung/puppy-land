## The island's cast besides the bread cat (Phase 1 Task 4h, art-direction.md section 12): Dugi
## (DugiActor) who explains and Puppy (PuppyActor) with the flag, placed per experiment by its
## definition's `cast` (content/experiments/<id>.json):
##   "cast": {"dugi": {"at": [x, z], "explain_on": [status, ...], "delay_s": s},
##            "puppy": {"at": [x, z]}}
## Both face the experiment's front camera. The shell (ExperimentScreen) adds the cast next to the
## lab under the 3D view, not inside it: the lab's own tree, bodies and physics are the same with or
## without it (tests/island_cast_checks.gd). The cast only reads the lab's status() and
## explain_point(); it never touches a body or a displayed value.
##
## When the lab's status has been one of `explain_on` for `delay_s`, Dugi explains once: he points at
## Experiment.explain_point() and the screen shows the lab's `observe` text (관찰 포인트, the same
## words as the sidebar) in his dialogue box. He explains again only after the status was outside
## `explain_on` for REARM_S (a status that flickers, the buoyancy drum bobbing about its floating
## depth, does not repeat it) or the user changed the run (rearm()).
