## A character that acts what the student does, in step with the formula model (Phase 1 Task 4g,
## art-direction.md section 11): it throws the projectile lab's ball, pushes the friction lab's box
## and has a hand in every other lab (holds and lets go, pulls, presses; 2026-10-27). "물리는 모델,
## 고양이는 연기": it never touches the physics (no body, no collision object, no layer); the labs'
## motion and panel values are the same with or without it
## (tests/bread_cat_checks.gd). What it looks like is a CatLook (meshes + the points of its body the
## acting uses: shoulders, reach, neck, ...), so the look can be replaced without touching the sync.
##
## The animation is code (no AnimationPlayer, no Tween): _process advances the clock and poses the
## rig from the mode the lab set:
##   hold(center, r, floor)  the left paw holds a ball of radius r centred at `center` (along the
##                           look's hold_dir from the shoulder, or a given direction: the right paw
##                           when it points to -x); the actor is placed so its arm reaches it,
##                           raised off `floor` when the ball is high (the lab draws a stand of
##                           stand_height) and kept under a `ceiling` (the arm stretches up)
##   throw(dir, on_release)  windup (the ball up and back over the head) and an overhand swing that
##                           reaches the hold pose moving along `dir`, fastest at the release; the ball (`carried`) follows the paw; on the frame the swing
##                           is back at the hold pose (the ball's launch point) on_release runs, then
##                           the arm follows through and rests
##   let_go(dir, retreat)    what the paws held was let go without a throw: the arms follow through
##                           along `dir` and settle, the lean and turn ease back, the actor steps to
##                           `retreat` (if given) and drops to its floor (a hanging pull)
##   push(face_x, ...)       both paws on the plane x = face_x (the box face), the actor behind it (-x),
##                           leaning with the effort
##   grab(root, yaw, pts)    both paws on two points from where the actor stands (on a stand the lab
##                           draws): it leans forward or back until its shoulders reach them (the arms
##                           stretch the rest); `effort` squashes the bread bag a little (pressing)
##   pull(grip, dir, ...)    both paws on a grip (a rope end, a ball) reached along `dir`: the actor
##                           stands where its paws reach it, on its floor or hanging from it when the
##                           grip is high (it jumps up to it), leaning back with the effort
##   cheer(arms)             a small hop (and paws up) when something lands or stops; with the paws
##                           busy (grab, pull, push) only a nod
## The look's hand nodes (under each arm, at the paw centre) show where the paws hold and touch.
